# Extension-specific settings

# pgvector settings
# No specific configuration needed, but ensure shared_buffers is adequate

# pg_jieba settings
# Default configuration is usually sufficient

# Full-text search
# Increase work_mem if doing complex text searches
# work_mem = 32MB  # Uncomment if needed

# Performance for JSONB
# GIN indexes benefit from larger maintenance_work_mem during creation

# Connection Pooling (if using PgBouncer)
# Consider lowering max_connections and using PgBouncer

# Client Authentication
# Edit pg_hba.conf for detailed access control
